# Breaking Ground
## An exploration and analysis of global seismic activity as reported by the US Geological Survey.
---
### ABSTRACT
The focus of this project was to analyze seismic activity to discover factors that contribute to the scale and frequency of earthquakes. While modern technology can provide early warning systems for some natural disasters, earthquakes remain relatively unpredictable. With a better understanding of the relationship between an earthquake's location, depth, & intensity, the damage caused by earthquakes can be better mitigated.

This project uses D3 and Leaflet in JavaScript to explore these relationships and identify potential collection biases.
